[00:03.86] Cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to hold
[00:11.56] They'd rather give you a song than diamonds or gold
[00:18.87] Lone star belt buckles and old faded Levi's
[00:22.65] And each night begins a new day
[00:26.77] If you don't understand him, and he don't die young
[00:30.52] He'll probably just ride away
[00:45.02] 
[00:36.69] Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
[00:43.74] Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks
[00:48.05] Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
[00:52.85] Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
[01:00.49] 'Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone
[01:04.84] Even with someone they love
[01:18.34] 
[01:10.63] Cowboys like smoky old pool rooms and clear mountain mornings
[01:18.15] Little warm puppies and children and girls of the night
[01:25.80] Them that don't know him won't like him and them that do sometimes won't know how to take him
[01:33.39] He ain't wrong, he's just different
[01:34.97] But his pride won't let him do things to make you think he's right
[02:07.97] 
[01:42.82] Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
[01:50.14] Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks
[01:54.22] Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
[01:59.12] Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
[02:06.39] 'Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone
[02:10.61] Even with someone they love
[02:24.11] 
[02:16.44] Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
[02:23.38] Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks
[02:27.35] Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
