Cut my tongue out
I've been caught out
Like a giant juggernaut
Happy hours
Golden showers
On a cruise to freak you out
We could fly a
Helicopter
Nothing left to talk about
Entertain you
Celebrate you
I'll be back to frame you

When I grow up
I'll be stable
When I grow up
I'll turn the tables

Trying hard to
Fit among you
Floating out to wonderland
Unprotected
God, I'm pregnant
Damn the consequences

When I grow up
I'll be stable
When I grow up
I'll turn the tables

Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba

Blood and blisters
On my fingers
Chaos rules when we're apart
Watch my temper
I go mental
I'll try to be gentle

When I grow up
I'll be stable
When I grow up
I'll turn the tables
When I grow up
When I grow up
When I grow up
I'll turn the tables

Don't take offence
Can I make amends?
Rip it all to shreds and let it go
Don't take offence
Can I make amends?
Rip it all to shreds and let it go

I rip it all to shreds and let it go
Rip it all to shreds and let it go
Rip it all to shreds and let it go
OOOH
